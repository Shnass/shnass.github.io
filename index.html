					<h1>A TICKET TO THE FESTIVAL YOU CHOOSE INSTEAD OF <a href="">BRAVE! FACTORY</a> 2022</h1>
				</header>

				<p>In August 2022 we were supposed to celebrate 5-year anniversary of Brave! Factory Festival but this will not happen due to the war. Instead, we invented multi-festival Brave Tickets: if you can not go to non-existing Brave! Factory 2022 you luckily can go to another festival existing with Brave Ticket.</p> 

				<p>This is a unique collaboration with our colleagues and like-minded people from around the world: we asked festivals we personally like if they would like to share their full tickets with us and they ALL said yes. Wow. Thank you.</p> 

				<p>60% of the money raised from the sales will be transferred to appropriate funds helping children who suffered in this war. 40% of the money will be used for this charity program production and saved for Brave! festival future production.</p> 

				<p>So. Buying one of Brave Tickets, you celebrate life and anniversary of Brave! Factory, you support Ukraine and our event. Plus you get a nice wooden card, which reminds us all that being alive is the biggest gift one might have.</p> 

				<p>Choose your festival and celebrate life.</p> 

				<p>Sincerely,<br/> Brave! Factory & Closer team</p>
